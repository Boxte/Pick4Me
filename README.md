# Tech Used

- React
- wit.ai
- Yelp Fusion API

# Limitations

This application works well on bigger screens such as desktop. I only tested this in the United States. The application gives proper options if there are enough restaurants in the city to supply the search query.

Voice support is limited to certain browsers:

- Chrome (desktop): this is by far the smoothest experience
- Microsoft Edge
- Chrome (Android): a word of warning about this platform, which is that there can be an annoying beeping sound when turning the microphone on. This is part of the Android OS and cannot be controlled from the browser
- Android webview
- Samsung Internet
